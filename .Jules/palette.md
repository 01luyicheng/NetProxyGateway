## 2024-05-18 - Smooth transitions in Jetpack Compose
**Learning:** For Jetpack Compose micro-UX improvements, abrupt state swaps (like changing an icon or its color instantly based on a boolean state) can feel jarring.
**Action:** Always prefer smooth transitions like `AnimatedVisibility`, `animateColorAsState`, and `Crossfade`/`AnimatedContent` over abrupt state swaps to provide better visual continuity. When using `Crossfade`, always compute derived properties (like the target icon) *inside* the lambda using the passed `targetState` parameter to prevent immediate outer-scope state updates from breaking the fade-out animation.
